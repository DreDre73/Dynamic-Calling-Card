# Dynamic-Calling-Card

In this project, I have combined my individual sketches with a navigation scaffold to create a comprehensive dynamic calling card (DCC). The DCC serves as a digital representation of myself, showcasing various aspects such as my interests, skills, and experiences.

## Objectives

Integration of My Individual Sketches:

1. Seamlessly integrated individual sketches within the navigation scaffold for a unified DCC experience.
2. Implemented a connected navigation system for effortless panel switching.
3. Enhanced user experience through intuitive navigation and engaging visuals.

## Steps Taken

- Analyzed individual sketches and planned integration process.
- Integrated sketches into navigation scaffold with attention to layout and functionality.
- Developed a functional navigation system for smooth transitions between panels.
- Conducted thorough testing and iteratively refined the DCC based on user feedback.

## Key Features

1. Various sketches seamlessly integrated within the navigation framework.
2. Fully connected navigation system for flexible exploration.
3. Enhanced visual feedback for intuitive navigation.

## Setup

To use the Dynamic Calling Card, follow these steps:

1. __Download the Repository:__ Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. __Watch__ [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vj9nDja8ZdQ&pp=ygUXcnVubmluZyBwNWpzIGluIHZzIGNvZGU%3D) on setting up p5 in vs code or visit [here](https://p5js.org/) for setting up p5 in your desired IDE.
3. __Explore the Dynamic Calling Card:__ Interact with the DCC by clicking on the navigation buttons to switch between panels and explore different aspects showcased in the sketches.

## Customization
- __Editing Sketches:__ Modify the individual sketches (sketch.js files) to personalize the content displayed in each panel.
- __Adjusting Navigation:__ Customize the navigation buttons and layout by modifying the index.html and sketch.js files.
- __Adding Your Content:__ Replace the images and text used in the sketches with your own content to tailor the DCC to your preferences.

## Using the p5.js Web Editor
Alternatively, you can use the p5.js Web Editor to edit and customize the Dynamic Calling Card:

1. Visit the [p5.js Web Editor](https://editor.p5js.org/).
2. Create a new sketch or import the provided sketch.js files.
3. Customize the sketches, navigation, and content to create your personalized DCC.
4. Save your changes and share the link with others to showcase your dynamic calling card.

## Conclusion

The integration of individual sketches with the navigation scaffold resulted in a comprehensive dynamic calling card. This interactive platform showcases my personality and experiences effectively. Moving forward, I will continue refining the DCC to ensure it delivers an exceptional user experience.
